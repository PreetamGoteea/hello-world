# hello-world
Touring github again.

I have been developing software commercial applications since the mid-1990s. I have developed from embedded solutions for 8 bit microcontrollers to parallel computing under MPI and Nvidia CUDA. Workwise, I am passionate about Microsoft technologies especially C#, F#, and the ASP.NET web stack. I hold and MCSD in Web Applications. My main interests are functional programming [F# and scala], parallel computing [CUDA, Microsoft TPL] and code generation. Yes, I am still fond of good old C and assembly programming :)
